> ch4-query.scm

Original scheme code for the query questions, with extentions added for the
answers (most at the bottom of the file; some added along the file as additions
to existing functions).
To run simple open scheme, load the file, initialize database and start the
query driver loop:
> scheme --load ch4-query.scm
scheme> (initialize-data-base microshaft-data-base)
scheme> (query-driver-loop)
scheme> <call test cases>

> reverse.pl
To run simply open prolog and load the file:
> prolog
prolog> ['reverse.pl'].
prolog> <call test cases>

Prolog implementation for the reverse function in question SICP 4.68 (with some
test cases).

> mini.pl

Prolog mini-language interpreter (answer to question 5).
To run simply open prolog and load the file:
> prolog
prolog> ['mini.pl'].
prolog> <call test cases>

> mini_test.pl

Test cases used to test the prolog mini-language interpreter (adopted from the
lecture slides).
