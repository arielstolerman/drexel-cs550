### summary ###

A compiler for the mini-language (does not support lists or functions).


### Files and Descriptions ###

> Makefile
The Makefile utility file for viewing, building and running the code.

> java-cup-11a.jar
Java CUP library

> jflex-1.4.3.jar
Java JFlex library

> interpretertext.cup
The CUP grammar definition input file, produces parser.java and sym.java.
Defines the parser grammar.

> interpretertext.flex
The JFlex tokenizer input file, produces Yylex.java.

> Program.java
Includes all classes for the mini-language parser AST construction and
compilation functionality.
Important added/modified classes and enums:
- SymbolType: enum for defining a type of value in the symbol table: constant,
  temporary, variable or a label
- SymbolValue: class for a value entry in the symbol table. Includes the
  type, value (may be null) and address (may be null)
- InstructionType: enum for different RAL instructions (LDA, STA etc.)
- Instruction: class for a RAL instruction, constructed of optional label,
  instruction and argument
- Component: an abstract class extended by Expr, Statement and StatementList
  to impose implementation of a translate method
- Program:
  The Program class is modified to provide several sets of methods:
  1) compile methods: includes the translate and optimize methods, both called
     by the compile method (two copies of translated instructions and symbol
     table are maintained - non-optimized and optimized).
     The translate and optimize methods also call link, which sets the address
     field of each symbol in the symbol table.
  2) dump to file methods: allow dumping the instructions (optimized or not)
     to files, either in a symbolic or linked representation.
     Linked representation will create the corresponding memory files.
  3) output methods: same as the dump methods, only output to the standard
     output.


### Build instructions ###

> view
Displays Program.java and the cup and flex source files.
(No modification is applied to the cup and flex files)

> compile
Compiles the input code from stdin and creates:
- symbolic RAL code in trans.txt
- linked code and initial memory image in linked.txt and linked_mem.txt,
  respectively
- linked code and initial memory image of the optimized version, where
  peephole optimizations are applied, in opt_linked.txt and opt_linked_mem.txt,
  respectively
The linked files above are suitable for running with the RAM simulator.

> view-trans
CATs the produced symbolic RAL code in trans.txt.

> view-link
CATs the linked RAL code and its initial memory image from linked.txt and
linked_mem.txt.

> view-op
CATs the linked optimized RAL code and its initial memory image from
opt_linked.txt and opt_linked_mem.txt. 

> run
Runs the RAM simulator under ~jjohnson/bin/ram on the linked code.

> run-op
Runs the RAM simulator as above on the linked optimized code.

> clean
> make clean
Cleans all temporary files generated during the build and compile process.


### Test ###

> test/
This directory contains (some of the) test cases with which we tested our project.
Each test file has an associated folder withe the output files (trans.txt etc.)
The compiled output memory image file contains comments about which address is
assigned to which variable, temp etc.
The test files were ran with the RAM simulator, and the results in the memory
at the end of the process were confirmed as the expected values for the
corresponding variables.
Test files:
- simple.p
- test1.p
- test2.p
- test3.p
- test4.p
